Missing Functionality in VaultPay
1. Receiver Experience
The current implementation doesn't fully address what happens on the receiver's side:

There's no clear notification system for when someone sends money to a user
The receiver doesn't have a dedicated interface to view and accept incoming escrow payments
There's no way for the receiver to mark conditions as completed
2. VTID Assignment and Tracking
While there is code to generate VTIDs (Vault Transaction IDs):

export const generateVTID = async (): Promise<string> => {
  const number = await getNextTransactionIdNumber();
  return `VTID-${String(number).padStart(6, '0')}`;
};
The implementation for how these are displayed to users and used for tracking is incomplete. There should be:

A way to search transactions by VTID
A detailed transaction view showing the VTID prominently
Possibly a QR code or sharing mechanism for the VTID

4. Transaction Completion Flow
The current implementation has gaps in how transactions are completed:

The updateTransactionCondition function checks if all conditions are completed, but the UI for marking conditions as complete is missing
There's an orderReceived flag in the transaction model, but no clear UI for the receiver to mark this
5. Dispute Resolution
There's no mechanism for:

What happens if the time limit expires
How disputes are handled
How refunds are processed
6. Real-time Updates
The app uses AsyncStorage but doesn't have:

Real-time notifications
WebSocket connections or polling for updates
Push notifications for transaction status changes
Recommendations for Implementation
For Receiver Experience:
Create a "Pending Receipts" section in the app where users can see incoming escrow payments
Add notification badges for new transactions
Implement a detailed view for receivers to accept payments and mark conditions as met
For VTID Tracking:
Add a transaction details screen that prominently displays the VTID
Implement a search function by VTID
Add a share button to easily send the VTID to the other party
Create transaction monitoring views with filtering and search
For Transaction Completion:
Add UI for receivers to mark conditions as complete
Implement a confirmation step for "order received"
Add automatic transaction expiration based on the time limit
